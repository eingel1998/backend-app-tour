  test('should have optimized indexes for frequent queries (conceptual)', async () => {
    // Placeholder: Payload typically handles index creation based on field definitions
    // (e.g., `index: true`, `unique: true` in collection configs) and relationships.
    // Actual test would involve:
    // 1. Defining collections with indexed fields.
    // 2. Initializing Payload.
    // 3. Inspecting the database schema directly (e.g., using `PRAGMA index_list('tableName');`
    //    and `PRAGMA index_info('indexName');` for SQLite) to verify indexes exist.
    expect(true).toBe(true); // Current placeholder

  test('should log slow queries correctly (conceptual)', async () => {
    // Placeholder: As investigated, direct slow query logging with specific thresholds (>500ms)
    // is not straightforwardly available in Payload with SQLite adapter by default.
    // This test notes the limitation.
    // If a solution were implemented (e.g. custom logger passed to Drizzle),
    // this test would try to trigger a slow query and check logs.

  test('should handle concurrent connections within limits (conceptual)', async () => {
    // Placeholder: For SQLite, "concurrent connections" usually means concurrent operations,
    // as it's file-based. WAL mode helps with concurrency.
    // `DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` is less relevant for SQLite.
    // An actual test might involve:
    // 1. Setting up Payload.
    // 2. Simulating multiple concurrent read/write operations (e.g., using Promise.all).
    // 3. Verifying that operations complete successfully without deadlocks or excessive errors,
    //    and within acceptable timeframes.
    // This is a complex test to set up correctly.
    expect(true).toBe(true); // Current placeholder
